                        Born in Bellevue but not your typical Bellevue girl. She
                        also worked on a farm & hauled wood, rides motorcycles,
                        and plays bass guitar.

                    <p>
                        Born in Germany, moved to US in 2010 for work, and fell
                        in love with the pacific northwest. Well, with Kristina
                        too but that took a few more years.
