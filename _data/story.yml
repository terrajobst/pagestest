      We met on the boat of a common friend. We enjoyed the sun, water, and a
      cringey a good portion of dad jokes. Hey, in Immo's defense: Kristina
      started with it.

      It all started innocently by just watching a British show 'Catastrophe'.
      Unlike Immo's date this was very much not a catastrophe. And soon after
      we realized we liked each other more than we thought.

      We waited a while before we told the kids.

      Unfortunately, Immo's mum was on her last legs due to a decade long fight
      with cancer. We decided to go together. While it wasn't exactly a
      vacation, Immo is incredibly thankful that his mum got to meet Kristina.
      And she very much approved of her.

      We waited a while before we told the kids because we needed to be sure
      that we could be a family. Our kids went through many changes over the
      last years. Thankfully they liked the idea very much: not only did they
      like each other, they also liked their future step parents. We can neither
      confirm nor deny that ice cream bribes were involved.

      Immo finally got his act together and proposed to Kristina. In the spirit
      of doing things differently, he did it during a camping trip with the kids
      while kneeling in a rocky riverbed. Hey, we're living in the pacific
      northwest. Sadly, Immo failed to secure sponsorship by REI.
